## Next Steps

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Create a new Web Service on Render
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure environment variables in Render dashboard
5. Deploy and monitor the build process
6. Test the application after deployment

The application is now fully prepared for deployment to Render with all necessary configurations and documentation.
